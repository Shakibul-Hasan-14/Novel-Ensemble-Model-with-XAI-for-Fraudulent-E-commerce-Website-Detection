# Novel Ensemble Learning Model with XAI for Fraudulent E-commerce Website Detection
The purpose of this project is to build a novel ensemble model to detect online business websites that are potentially fraud, and explain to customers why the e-commerce has been flagged.

## Module 1
The collected data was preprocessed in this module. </br>

## Module 2
Different algorithms were tested on the preprocessed dataset, and the best 3 models were taken as bases for the ensemble.

## Module 3
Different algorithms were tested, and the best 1 was selected as the meta model.

## Module 4
XAI was integrated for customer transparency and readibility.

## Module 5
Comparsion of the novel machine learning model with other popular ensembles.
